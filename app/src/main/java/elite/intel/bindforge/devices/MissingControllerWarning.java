/**
 * Says once per run which of the user's named controllers are not attached while bindings name them - and then
 * waits and sees. Nothing is changed and nothing is repaired: an entry deliberately outlives its hardware, which is
 * what makes a stick work again when it is plugged back in.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Not at Elite-Intel startup - the first time the user opens Alias Designer</strong> (Alan, 2026-10-11, A13).
 * BindForge stays quiet until the user comes to it, and by then the Device Service has been listing controllers
 * since launch. "Once per run" is once per Elite-Intel process: this holds the one warning for the whole run.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Spoken, and logged</strong> (Alan, 2026-10-11): the spoken line names the controllers, the log line also
 * says how many bindings name each.
